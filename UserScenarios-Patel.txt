Using the StuddyBuddi website for meeting new people

Charles is a new student at UNC Charlotte and is looking forward to taking
computer science classes. While taking the calculus prerequisites, Charles
was struggling to feel motivated to do homework or study for the class. When
he found the StuddyBuddi site, Charles was skeptical on whether he would find
people from his class who related to his study needs. 
Charles began making a profile and was able to select the class and section 
he needed help for, the times he wanted to meet, the number of people he wanted
to meet with, and the type of studying he wanted to do. He was also able to 
use tags on his profile to display his hobbies and interests. 
After completing his profile, Charles was able to look through the list of 
students and find two that he shared hobbies and free time with, Evan and Kammy. 
After Charles got an email notification that both his study partners had also 
matched with him, he was able to message them individually and then create a 
groupchat. He found he studied well with Evan and Kammy, and they were able to 
continue studying together. 
While studying together, they were able to talk more about their similar 
interests in movies and get to know each other more. The next semester, they
found they chose the same section for another class, and were able to work as a 
group for that class.
